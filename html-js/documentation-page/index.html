          ok so you have the variables. Const = constant meaning the variable
          cannot be reassigned. Let => can be reassinged. And the var which no
          one uses...
        </p>
        <code
          >var cactus = "me"; let cactusCount = 100; var cactusNames = ['me',
          'you'];
        </code>
        <p>
          Then the variable types. We have string, which is just a name or some
          words. Then int, float and stuff, that's basically just numbers. And
          the arrays which is like a list containing multiple other variables.
          Then there's the object, but that's too complex to describe over
          here...
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Conditionals">
        <header><h2>Conditionals</h2></header>
        <p>alright the conditionals...</p>
        <code
          >If (cactus === 'best things ever') { console.log('cactus is best
          things ever'); }else { console.log('cactus is not best things ever
          :('); }</code
        >
        <p>
          you can use a if else statement. Which will do anything in the {} as
          long as the condition in () is equal to true. And the Else is for what
          to do when the condition is equal to False. You don't need else
          statement if you don't need it.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Promises">
        <header><h2>Promises</h2></header>
        <p>
          Pretty easy. If you have a function or some kind of action, that could
          take some unknown time and that could throw an error, then you should
          use a promise. You can declare a promise by using the new operator.
          Use resolve or any call sign in the func args.
        </p>
        <code
          >const mypromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(()=>
          { resolve('foo'); }, 300); });</code
        >
        <p>
          You can use await or .then(), .catch(). Await can only work in async
          function... Then is what will be run, when the promise is resolved.
          Catch is used to handle errors... Be carefull, you need to use
          function in the .then or .catch
        </p>
        <code
          >mypromise.then((resolveValue)=> { console.log(resolveValue); })</code

      <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_for_web">
        <header><h2>JavaScript for web</h2></header>
        <p>Alrighty easy peasy</p>
        <code>document.querySelector('#mamamia').style.color = "white";</code>
        <p>
          querySelector is selecting an element which you give into the string
          like in css. Then you can use the .style and a css property or how
          it's called. You get the idea right?
        </p>
        <p>
          There's probably much more to JS for web, but this is easy and I don't
          know much more soo...
